# C-lessons Task 01

Write a c program which iterates over the the numbers 1 to 100 and prints "Fizz" on the numbers divisable by 3, "Buzz" on the numbers divisable by 5 and "FizzBuzz" on numbers divisable by 3 and 5.

Hint: the Modulo operator % gives you the remainder of a division.
> 15%2 == 1
> 15%3 == 0
