\begin{frame}[fragile]{Task 3: Control Structures}
This week we learned about \code{for}, \code{do..while}, and \code{switch}.
But all of these concepts are just syntactic sugar for the basics that 
we learned about last time: \code{if} and \code{while}.

Try to reproduce the output of the following three blocks of code exactly 
using only the control structures \code{if}, \code{else} and \code{while}.

You may introduce as many variables and statements as yout want, 
but try to aim for the shortest possible solution. 

If you already feel very comfortable using the new control structures 
and just want to get straight into it, you can of course skip 
this warm up task :).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Task 3.1: For}
\begin{codeblock}
for(int i = 0; i< 10; i++){
    puts("Hello");
}
\end{codeblock}

It would be kind of dumb, but could we do it without
any control structures at all?

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Task 3.2: Do While}
\begin{codeblock}
int x = 0;
do{
    i++;
    printf("%i\n", i);
    i++;
}while(x < 9);
\end{codeblock}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Task 3.3: Switch}
\begin{codeblock}
for(int i = 0;i<100;i++){
    switch(i % 3 + 2 * (i % 5)){
        case 0: printf("%i\n", i); break;
        case 1: puts("Fizz!"); break;
        case 2: puts("Buzz!"); break;
        case 3: puts("FizzBuzz!"); break;
    }
}
\end{codeblock}

This might look familiar, eh? Try to preserve the logic shown here 
as closely as possible during your conversion. 
Remember: You may introduce additional variables.
