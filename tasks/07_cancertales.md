# Task 7

Add an enemy player to cancertales, who can be killed if the @ player is in range of
two fields around the enemy. To kill the player has to press the k key. 

Notice: The enemy player can only move when the player does aswell.
This is currently a limitation of this very simple console game. 

The cancertales code can be found here [https://github.com/jkrbs/c_lessons/src/cancertales.c](https://github.com/jkrbs/c_lessons/src/cancertales.c)
